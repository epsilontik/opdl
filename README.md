The **O**pen **P**odcast **D**escription **L**anguage aims to develop a data model for podcasts. It should cover the following areas

* PodcastsÂ 
* Episodes of podcasts
* Bookmarks and comments
* Collections of podcasts

In this context the model shall not only describe the podcasts themselves but also cover aspects of interaction with users and their clients. Obvious examples include that the data model includes structures for comments on podcasts/episodes and information about how far a certain episode has already been played.

OPDL shall facilititate the exchange of podcast information between various platforms as well as the interoperability of podcast clients.

In the first step, OPDL comprises two areas:
* A UML model 
* A description of all data types in ASN.1 notation
